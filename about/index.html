	<h1>About me</h1>
	<p>I'm currently studying electrical engineering at Princeton University. Originally a chemical and biological engineer, I soon realized that I loved to code. My career aspirations are now hopefully to make an impact on the world with my work, particularly within the scope of social innovation. On campus, I'm heavily involved with promoting social entrepreneurship and innovation as the president of Princeton Social Innovation (check out the site <a href="http://princetonsi.com/"" target="_blank">here</a>). Social innovation is constantly changing the world, and I want to contribute my fair share towards improving the world that we all live in. In addition, I'm also a tutor for my fellow peers. </p>

			<h3>Summer 2017 research</h3>
			<p>I spent this past summer looking at and learning more about wormlike micelle flow. I expanded upon already existing MATLAB algorithms that tracked fluorescent tracer particles to enable real-time visualization of the particular flow that I was investigating. This also involved some scripting with the microscope-mounted camera itself (sadly I don't have the code to that anymore); however, I fortunately do have all the MATLAB code I worked with (on my github).

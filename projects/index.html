			<h3>Summer 2017 research</h3>
			<p>I spent this past summer looking at and learning more about wormlike micelle flow. I expanded upon already existing MATLAB algorithms that tracked fluorescent tracer particles to enable real-time visualization of the particular flow that I was investigating. This also involved some scripting with the microscope-mounted camera itself (sadly I don't have the code to that anymore); however, I fortunately do have all the MATLAB code I worked with (on my github). If this is interesting to you, check out my <a href="abstract.pdf" target="_blank">abstract</a> and my <a href="Kevin Liu_SURF.pdf" target="_blank">presentation</a>.

			<h3>Particle tracking</h3>
			<p>I wrote these programs (see flow-analysis on my github) as part of the final assignment of my introductory programming course; coincidentally, these programs mesh very well with my summer 2017 research work. These programs locate particles undergoing Brownian motion, and track them between different image frames. This then allows for an estimate of the Boltzmann constant, which is used to then estimate Avogadro's number. This method is less efficient than the MATLAB algorithms in my summer 2017 research project, but provides a fundamental understanding of how tracking works and insight into its optimization.
